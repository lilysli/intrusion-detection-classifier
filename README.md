# intrusion-detection-classifier
A practical project comparing the results of a multi-class classification model built using softmax vs different decision trees to identify various network attack types (e.g., DoS, Fuzzers, Exploits) and normal traffic. 

Dataset used is NF-UNSW-NB15-v3 from:
Luay et al. (2025), "Temporal Analysis of NetFlow Datasets for Network Intrusion Detection Systems", arXiv:2503.04404. Available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04404
